    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>4. Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>General.</strong> The Service offers both Free Features and Paid Features under a subscription model.
      Paid subscriptions (“Subscriptions”) are managed exclusively through the Apple App Store or Google Play Store
      and are subject to the terms and conditions of those respective platforms, including but not limited to renewal,
      cancellation, and refund policies.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Free Features.</strong> You may access certain basic functionality without charge. We may impose limits
      on usage (for example, a finite number of free “generate” actions per day) which may be adjusted at our discretion.
      We reserve the right to change or discontinue Free Features at any time without notice.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Paid Features (Profanally Pro).</strong> To access Premium Features (sometimes referred to as “Profanally Pro”),
      you must subscribe to one of the available subscription plans offered through the App Store or Google Play Store.
      The subscription plans currently available are:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Subscription Title:</strong> Profanally Pro</li>
        <li><strong>Subscription Length:</strong> 1 month, 3 months, or 1 year (depending on the plan you select)</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Subscription Price:</strong> The applicable price for each plan will be displayed in your local currency
          on the App Store or Google Play Store at the time of purchase. Prices are subject to change, and any changes
          will take effect at the start of the next billing cycle following notice to you.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Auto-Renewal.</strong> All subscription plans are “auto-renewing.” Subscriptions will automatically renew at the
      end of the applicable subscription period unless Auto-Renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the
      then-current period. The User’s Apple ID or Google account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end
      of the then-current period, at the subscription price then in effect.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Billing and Payment.</strong> When you subscribe through the App Store or Google Play Store, payment is processed by
      Apple Inc. or Google LLC. We do not collect or store your payment information. You agree that your Apple ID or Google account
      will be charged the subscription fee in accordance with the billing terms of the App Store or Google Play Store. You also
      acknowledge that Apple or Google will manage all aspects of your subscription, including renewal and cancellation.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Subscription Management.</strong> You can manage your subscription and turn off Auto-Renewal by going to your App Store or
      Google Play account settings. You may also view your subscription details, change subscription plans, or cancel at any time.
      If you cancel your Subscription, you will continue to have access to Premium Features until the end of the billing period, after
      which your Subscription will terminate and your account will revert to the Free Features tier.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Refund Policy.</strong> We do not provide refunds for the unused portion of any subscription period. All refund requests
      must be made directly through Apple or Google and are subject to their respective refund policies. Any disputes regarding billing
      or refunds must be addressed with Apple or Google, as we neither have access to nor control over subscription billing.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Price Changes.</strong> We reserve the right to increase subscription fees at the end of the then-current billing period.
      If we change the subscription price, we will notify you in advance by updating the Service and your subscription plan. If you
      do not agree to the new price, you may cancel your subscription prior to the next renewal date.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Trial Offers and Promotions.</strong> We may, from time to time, offer trial subscriptions or promotional pricing to certain users.
      Those trial offers and promotions will be governed by the terms and conditions of the offer, which we will make available to you at
      the time of offer. Once the trial period expires, the Subscription will automatically convert to a paid subscription at the then-current
      subscription price unless you cancel prior to the expiration of the trial period.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Taxes.</strong> You are responsible for paying any taxes associated with your subscription, including applicable sales tax,
      value-added tax (VAT), or other similar taxes, as required by law.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>5. Content and Usage</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>AI-Generated Content.</strong> The Service uses artificial intelligence (“AI”) to generate alternative versions of user-submitted text.
      You understand and agree that:
      <ul>
        <li>The AI-generated content is provided for general guidance only and may not be accurate, complete, reliable, or appropriate for all contexts.</li>
        <li>You are solely responsible for verifying the accuracy, legality, and appropriateness of any AI-generated content before relying on or sharing it.</li>
        <li>We disclaim any and all liability arising from or related to your use of or reliance upon AI-generated content.</li>
      </ul>

        <li>Collect or store personal data about other users.</li>

        <li>Impersonate any person or entity or falsely state or misrepresent your affiliation with any person or entity.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Linking to Third-Party Sites.</strong> The Service may contain links to third-party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by us. We assume no responsibility for the content, policies, or practices of any third-party websites or services. If you access a third-party website, you do so at your own risk and subject to the terms of service and privacy policies of that third party.
    </li>
  </ol>
